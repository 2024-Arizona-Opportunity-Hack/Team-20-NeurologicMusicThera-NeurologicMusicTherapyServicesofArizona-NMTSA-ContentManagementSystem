## Project Overview
Brief description of your project and its goals.
Inspiration
Team ByteForce aims to create a content management software for a non profit organization called NMSTA which uses musical therapy to help individuals with disabilities. The services the non profit conducts includes therapy,
  music lessons, and proffesional development.
  A challenge that NMSTA faced was organizing their Google Drive as they simply had so many files that it seemed impossible to track every single one of them and distribute them to different types of users. As a result,
  they were looking for a software that could organize their chaotic google Drive and allow them to send their files to any user with ease.


## Tech Stack
- Frontend: 
- Backend: 
- Database: 
- APIs:

What does it do?
- Content Management
- Automative Tagging
- Content Classification

 How we built it
 The Backend/APIS/databases includes.
 Django
 SQLite 
 HuggingFace
 Rest Framework

The AI includes.
Meta-LLama-3
OpenAI Whisper
OpenAI CLIP

 The Front End includes.
 Next.js
 React
 Tailwind
 shadCN
 TypeScript
 
<!-- Add/modify as needed -->

Challenges we ran into.
Some challenges that we struggled with was when we creating our frontend with specifically shadCN components. The documentation was not ideal and it made it extremely difficult to customize our software. Next, Tailwind's
theming would prove to be an issue to us because we had to manually adjust the settings which provided to give much difficulty to us. Finally, making a custom datatable with Next.js was extremely hard because the document 
was once again horrible and amped up the difficulty of making the software.

Accomplishments that we are proud of.
One of the accomplishemnts that we are proud of is that we managed to integrate three unique AI models including a LLM, CNN, and Transformer model all witin our software integrating perfectly with each other. Another
implementation we are proud of is we the fact that we designed a fully functional back end and front end that allows improves effiency by enhancing file searching, indexing, and content management which all in turn leads to a 
streamlined user experience. 

 What we learned.
 Some tasks that we learend was how to implement different AI models using HuggingFace within the backend of a software. Furthermore, we gained a deeper understanding of how we can use Tailwind, Next.js, shadCN to 
 make good looking software. Finally, we learned how to use Django to make a backend functional and render Rest APIs to serve the front end.

What is next for our Content Management Software?
Eventually, we plan to integrate Google Drive into our software to manage files within Drive as well as normal files. Furthermore, we plan on implementing a chatbot that allows the user to chat with the files on the CMS
for instant insights on widespread data.
